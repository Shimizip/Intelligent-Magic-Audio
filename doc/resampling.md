1. FIR Filter-Based Decimation: Focuses on removing unwanted high-frequency components before down-sampling to prevent aliasing. It involves convolution with filter coefficients.
1. Linear Interpolation: Estimates new sample values directly based on linear relationships between known samples, without explicitly filtering the signal.
